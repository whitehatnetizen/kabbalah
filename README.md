# Kabbalah — Tree of Life

An interactive study aid for memorising and understanding the Kabbalah according to the traditional Jewish approach.

## What This Is

This is a standalone HTML page featuring an interactive Tree of Life (Etz Chaim) diagram. It presents the ten Sefirot with their Hebrew names, meanings, and associated biblical sources to support learning and contemplation.

## Traditional Approach

This visualisation follows traditional Jewish Kabbalistic teachings. It does **not** include Golden Dawn or Western esoteric additions such as:

- Tarot card correspondences
- The paths from Hod and Netzach to Malkuth
- Other syncretic mappings from 19th/20th century occultism

The goal is to provide a tool grounded in authentic Jewish mystical tradition.
